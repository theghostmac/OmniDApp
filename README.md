# Build a Simple DApp for NFT Marketplace and Eth Exchanges

This project demonstrates the usage of ReactJS, Solidity, and TailwindCSS in quickly building a smart contract on Hardhat.

It is in no way a properly working application, but a demo for a tutorial article published on LogRocket.

I should remember to add the link to the article after it is being published by LogRocket content team.
